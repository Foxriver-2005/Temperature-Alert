Temperature Alert  Using Machine Learning and IoT.

Why machine learning using Internet of Things.
    • Use analysis & visualization tools on ThingSpeak for more advanced data analysis like deploying error basis, normalizing performance across a suite of tests.
    • Set up email alerts in response to changes in performance.
    • Use machine learning for anomaly detection and generate smart alerts.

Challenges of IoT
    • Complex systems – hard to get started.
    • No single vendor solutions.
    • Multiple expertise required to build a system.
    • Lack consolidation of industry standards.

Analyze data – MATLAB integration allows users to run scheduled code on data coming into ThingSpeak.
